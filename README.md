# Managing-students-system
In the project, I created a managing student system in Python.
The system helps tutors and teachers who want to save data about their students, lessons, pay and tax.
This project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles along with the powerful data manipulation capabilities of pandas, a Python Data Analysis Library, to efficiently manage and process data, including data stored in Excel files.
